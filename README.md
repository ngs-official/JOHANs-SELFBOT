## 🛠️ | Setup
Get ready to start using this very soon!

### 📃 Instructions
1. Get your token by opening the developer console in the Discord browser app, then go to the 'Network' category; then reload the page and click on any variable to scroll down in the details and until to find 'Authorization:' where your Discord user token will be stored.
2. Put your token in the first line of the 'setup.txt' file, replacing the 'your-token' text with it.
3. Put whatever you want as your preferred prefix in the second line, replacing the 'prefix' text already there.
4. Open the 'start.bat' file to begin the selfbot, use the help command to see all the available commands.
If you need help you may DM me on Discord at 'johan.real' and don't feel shy.
